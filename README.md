## Before arriving at the workshop

0. You can familiarize yourself with unix ([here](https://astrobiomike.github.io/unix/unix-intro) and/or [here](https://sunagawalab.ethz.ch/share/teaching/bioinformatics_praktikum/index.html)) and [conda](https://astrobiomike.github.io/unix/conda-intro)

1. You must have Anvi'o v8 installed on your laptop, see [anvio.org/install/](anvio.org/install/). 

## Morning talks

Tom & Lucas will (1) introduce environmental genomics, (2) describe automatic binning and genomic resources, (3) use evolutionary environmental genomics to shed new light on the viral world, and (4) use global scale environmental genomics to explore the biosynthetic potential of the ocean microbiome.

The presentations will be uploaded in the corresponding [folder](https://github.com/LucasPaoli/Qlife-2024-Environmental-Genomics/tree/main/talks).

## Digital workshop 

Please go to the corresponding [folder](https://github.com/LucasPaoli/Qlife-2024-Environmental-Genomics/tree/main/digital-workshop) and follow the instructions.
